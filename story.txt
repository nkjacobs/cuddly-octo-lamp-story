There onece was a boy named Yohan. He loved to walk the streets of Madison,
looking for anything to do. One day he was walking by the shore when he 
saw a yellow spotted turtle that was on its back.

he was surprised by the color of the turtle and walked near it, picked it up and hold it on his hand.
Suddenly, the turtle spoke: "Could you do me a favor? little children? if you help me, I can realize 3 of your dreams!"

Yohan stared at the spotted pink turtle for some time, marveling at its shell for some time before he heard his voice
say.
"Wait, wasnt this turtle's shell just yellow?"
That was of course when the LSD went into full effect and Yohan stumbled dropping the turtle as it transformed into a
ball of garbage.

Yohan went on his walk along the lakeshore path. As he looked along the shoreline, and realized that there were
 many more spotted turtles following behind him. 
"You can't escape us", they said. Yohan just nodded and went along his merry way. 

As Yohan walked, he tried not to think about the turtles he had left behind. "They are but turtles",
he thought. The are slow, and he did not believe they could harm him. Lost in thought, he tripped and
fell. Worried, he turned around to see that the turtles had all vanished. Annoyed, he tried to stand back
up, only to find it difficult to stand on his legs. As he struggled, his backpack weighed down on him 
more and more. Yohan stumbled down to the shore to look at his reflection, only to find that he himself
had become a turtle. "This is some good LSD", he said.
