There onece was a boy named Yohan. He loved to walk the streets of Madison,
looking for anything to do. One day he was walking by the shore when he 
saw a yellow spotted turtle that was on its back.

he was surprised by the color of the turtle and walked near it, picked it up and hold it on his hand.
Suddenly, the turtle spoke: "Could you do me a favor? little children? if you help me, I can realize 3 of your dreams!"
